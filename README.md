## Luminor Bank task

This project is implemented using React and Redux with TypeScript. Styling is done with Material-UI.

You can view demo <a href="https://lum-hw.000webhostapp.com/">here</a><br />
IMPORTANT NOTE: free hosting service used for Demo doesn't support folders, so refreshing for example <a href="https://lum-hw.000webhostapp.com/orders">orders page</a> will result in 404. This however doesn't happen in development environment.

Local storage serves as a database and is prefilled with 3 users and 6 books on application launch.<br />
You can login using either admin credentials:<br />
`username: admin, password: admin`<br />
or one of 2 clients:<br />
`username: client1, password: client1`<br />
`username: client2, password: client2`

Special thank you for book covers to website to <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/books/the-30-best-book-covers-of-2015/">Paste Magazine</a>
